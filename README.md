# JavaScript Data Structures


## Objects in JavaScript
Objects in JavaScript are complex data types used to represent real-world entities.
Objects consist of key-value pairs, where each key (property) has an associated value.
Keys (property names) can be strings, and values can be of any valid JavaScript data type.
Objects can store nested and grouped data for organizing complex information.
 
## Object Creation and Property Naming
Object literals enclosed in curly braces {} are a common way to create objects in JavaScript.
Object keys (property names) can be enclosed in quotes (single or double) or left unquoted, with certain naming rules.
Quoted keys allow for arbitrary strings with spaces and special characters.
Unquoted keys should start with a letter or specific characters like _, $, or any Unicode character.

## Accessing Object Properties
Two common methods for accessing object properties are dot notation and square brackets.
Dot notation is used when the property name is known in advance, while square brackets are useful when the name is unknown or stored in a variable.
Nested properties are accessed using dot notation with a path separated by dots.

## Object Methods
Object methods are functions defined within objects, allowing data and related functionality to be coupled.
The this keyword refers to the object calling the method, enabling access to its properties.
Object methods offer logical organization, data encapsulation, and improved code readability.
Methods can access object properties using the this keyword and interact with them using dot notation.
